Thousand Parsec uses [http://git.or.cz/ Git] to manage its source code. Git is a distributed version control system that was at first created for Linux kernel development and has since then become popular with other open source projects.

Here are some instructions to help you get started with Git.

== Cogito ==

Before you start it is advisable to also install [http://git.or.cz/cogito/ Cogito]. Cogito is a user-friendly frontend to Git, which makes Git easier to use. While newest versions of Git include some features from Cogito, Cogito is still a nice tool to have around.

== Where is the source code ==

All the source code for Thousand Parsec sub-projects is available in our '''[http://git.thousandparsec.net/ central repository]'''. Developers first commit the changes to their local repository and when they get to the Internet connection push all the commits to the central server.

To see the summary of the sub-project just click on it's name in the on-line browser. This way you get the URLs you can use to get the code and some other information like short changelog.

== Getting the code ==

This is how you download the code from a remote repository to your local one:

Cogito:
 cg-clone git://git.thousandparsec.net/git/'''project-name'''.git

Where you replace project-name with the actual name of the desired project.

== Updating the code ==

When you already have the code and would like to update it to the latest revision you issue this command ''from within the project's folder'':

Cogito:
 cg-update
