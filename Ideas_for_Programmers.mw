Are you a developer who wishes to get started helping with Thousand Parsec? Perhaps you are a computer science student looking for a project that will help you improve your practical programming and teamwork skills? In any case, you have come to the right place.

Below are some of the ideas and suggestions for people who would like to join in the fun of creating video games. The list is not definitive and anyone is encouraged to come up with their own idea to work on. Initiative and imagination rate highly when working on any project.

You will notice that in some ideas "3 month timeframe" is mentioned. This is only relevant if you participate in [[Google Summer of Code]], where you have about 3 months to finish a project. If you are interested in working on Thousand Parsec outside of GSoC you can safely ignore this.

For additional ideas you can also take a look at [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=132078&atid=829724 Thousand Parsec TODO list].

= Rulesets =

Thousand Parsec's greatest strength is that it is a protocol for describing games, not a single game [[Rulesets|ruleset]]. Obviously then the more (complete) rulesets the better.

You can choose to implement the rulesets in either the Python Server or in the C++ Server. Both servers currently only implement MiniSec but have been designed to support a wide variety of other rulesets.

All these tasks will require C++ skills (if developing for the C++ Server) or Python (if developing for the Python Server). You may need to do some work on the core of the server if you are doing more advanced stuff too.

== MTSec ==

MTSec (short for Missile and Torpedo Wars) is a simple game designed to flex the ship and weapon design capabilities of Thousand Parsec. It is the first ruleset to have a simple economy and should be more interesting then the first prototype game MiniSec. A start has been made to the C++ implementation, but needs a lot of work.

=== Required Skills ===
* C++ skills or Python skill.

== [[Clone_Ruleset|Clone an Existing Game]] ==
Thousand Parsec is the ideal framework to clone your favourite 4X game!

Please look at the [[Clone Ruleset]] page for some ideas of possible rulesets.

== The Universe in an Hour ==

Design a simple ruleset in which a whole game can be finished in an hour.

= Clients =

Thousand Parsec is designed to allow many different clients to connect to the same server and still fully participate. Currently the [http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=tpclient-pywx.git;a=summary main client] is written in Python. There are also clients for [http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=parsek.git;a=summary KDE in C++] and [http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=galaxie.git;a=summary EFL in C].

You can help us by  writing a new client for Thousand Parsec. This client will service people who are not in a situation to use tpclient-pywx.

These tasks are a reasonable amount of work, depending on which language you choose you may need to improve (or implement from scratch) a protocol library. You will need to be a reasonable coder before you start any of these projects if you hope to succeed.

== Web based client ==

A web based client enables players to join Thousand Parsec games easily from any computer with a web browser and internet connection. This makes web based client the fastest and easiest way to start playing the game.

Any language could be used for the client. Some suggestions are PHP, Python or Ruby. It might be a good idea to use AJAX or something similar.

It is expected that the client has the following functionality:

* Support for displaying the Starmap
* Support for displaying all information about objects
* Support for issuing orders
* Support for creating designs

=== Required Skills ===
Strong Web development skill.

== 3D Client ==

A cool 3D client for Thousand Parsec is needed. A [http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=tpclient-pyogre.git;a=summary pyOgre client] was started but is in need of quite a bit of love. You could choose to use that as a base or start a new client from scratch.

This client can be developed in either C++ or Python. Having a prebuilt and tested protocol library is important as the amount of work required for just a 3d client is substantial, hence theses are the '''only languages''' we will accept.


It is expected that the client has the following functionality
* Support for displaying the Starmap
* Support for displaying all information about objects
* Support for issuing orders
* Support for creating designs
* '''Having a good UI is more important then flashy graphics which can be improved later.'''


You could look at the following games for some ideas,

=== Required Skills ===
* Some 3D development skills.
* Strong coding skills in language of choice.

== AI Clients ==

An AI client in Thousand Parsec games connects to the game as a normal client and has exactly the same information as a normal player would have. [http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=tpsai-py.git;a=summary tpsai-py] implements a some-what simple AI for Minisec. [http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=galaxie.git;a=summary Galaxie] also has an inbuilt AI. There are many improvements that could be made to these AI, and possibly made more generic so that they could be used with other rulesets.

While it would be nice to have an AI client which adapts to any ruleset, this will '''NOT''' be possible in 3 months. We recommend that you concentrate on a specific ruleset (such as [[TP_RFTS|RFTS Clone]] or [http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/dev/documents/mtsec.php MTSec]).

An option might be intergrating with a resource allocation library like [http://www.librcps.org/ libRCPS]. It is okay to use external supporting libraries. Another good resource is [http://mirror.linux.org.au/linux.conf.au/2007/video/tuesday/tuesday_1450_gaming.ogg Wesnoth for Kernel Hackers] talk at [http://linux.conf.au/ Linux.conf.au], Rusty Russell talks about his solution to some of the complex AI battle problems.


The AI will be expected to be do most of the following:
* Able to complete games when playing against itself.
* Offer a challange to newer player.


The AI will '''NOT''' be able to do any of the following
* Intergrate with the server, it must be a stand alone program.
* Cheat or have some other handicap, it must play by the same rules as everyone else.

=== More Information ===
* [http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=tpsai-py.git;a=summary Existing Python Simple AI].
* [http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=galaxie.git;a=summary Client with inbuilt AI], written in C.

You will need to get a good knowledge of the ruleset you are writing the AI for.

* [http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/dev/documents/mtsec.php MTSec] - Page describing the MTSec dynamics.

=== Required Skills ===
* Good programming skills
* Some knowledge of 4X games is recommended
* Some knowledge of AI programming is recommended

= Tpserver-cpp =

[[tpserver-cpp]] is one of the main servers in Thousand Parsec. These project ideas deal with improving it in various ways.

You will need some C++ skills before you start any of these projects (but not as much as if you where implementing a ruleset for this server). [[User:Lee Begg|Lee]] (llnz) is happy to mentor anyone working in these areas.

== Persistence modules ==

Tpserver-cpp has an abstract persistence interface that allows different methods of saving the game data. Currently, only a basic MySQL module has been written.

The interface it fairly straight forward, but there is likely to be changes to the interface as the new game features are created and the internal architecture changes.

Possible databases include:
* [http://www.postgresql.org/ PostgresSQL]
* [http://www.sqlite.org/ SQLite]
* Generic SQL using odbc or similar

==== Required Skills ====
* SQL (preferably MySQL and the target database) experience

== Calendar Timer ==
tpserver-cpp supports plug-able methods for triggering the end of turn processing. The current TurnTimer supports threshold finished changing of the timer, which is set in seconds.

A new timer, called CalendarTimer could be developed that starts the EOT processing at the same calendar time (IE, everyday at 12:03am or similar). [http://www.boost.org/doc/html/date_time.html Boost.Date_Time] might be a good starting point.

== Rework Module System ==
tpserver-cpp module system works ok, but could be better. It could be just a matter of adding a layer of indirection in.

Some things that would be nice to have:
* Modules dependencies
* New types of modules (advertising methods, universe builders, etc)
* Load all modules, list their names on the console (on command), use some modules, unload rest.

== More useful fail frames ==
Fail frames as of [[TP04]] have a list of General Purpose References. Most of the createFailFrame calls currently do not set the list of references. They need to be added.  Some things don't yet have reference types yet, they will also need to be added to the protocol.

== Console guided setup ==
Make is possible that when started with no config file, ask the users a number of questions to set up the server and the game. tpserver-cpp uses [[libtprl]] for the console, and it supports changing command sets.

== Separate the console from the server ==
Make it possible to connect remotely, or at least locally, to a daemon-ized tpserver-cpp. Need to pass commands into the server and get logging and output back. Could be quite a few ways to do this. Maybe a special server configuration protocol could be designed so that various different configuration interfaces (for example integrated into clients, presented as Single Player mode) could connect to a special configuration port.

== New Rulesets ==
New rulesets can be written for tpserver-cpp, see [[#Rulesets|Rulesets]] section below.

== Change to use Boost.Random ==
We currently have a reasonable PRNG, which Boost.Random also supplies, but only a limited set of random variables. This could be changed by replacing the custom implementation with Boost.Random.

= Development Tools =

These projects are about improving or creating standalone tools for Thousand Parsec. They are the mostly self contain projects, however it is still expected that you be involved with the rest of the project.

Some of these projects might require you to extend the Thousand Parsec protocol or specify out new features. These will need to be public discussed on the mailing lists.

== Ruleset Development Environment ==

Scheme is quite a hard language to write. tpcl the language which is used for communicating between server and client the details about Designs, components and properties is based on Scheme.

For SoC 2007, DystopicFro wrote a Ruleset Development Environment called tpruledev. It is written in python, and works well for Designs, components and properties. But since then, there have been changes to tpserver-cpp that require reflecting in tpruledev, and some new features in TP04 are close to being useful and so could now be done inside tpruledev (namely Object Descriptions). So there are few improvements that could be made, and more are coming soon.

== Race Designer ==

Meet strange and interesting races... and kill them. One of the core tenants of the modern 4X game. [http://wiki.gible.net/index.php?title=Race_Design Race design for Stars!] is an art form, with few major race strategies (HP, HG, -F...), and dozens of minor variations. Other games feature fixed races - do you play the strange robotic machines, or the orange giant insects of Epsilon Persei III.

The goal for this project is to design and implement a protocol for player races. Protocol and server support are a necessity, as is a (portable) client that can create races in some way. Race files will need to be saved and distributed. Take into account both fixed races (ala Master of Orion) or races built using another ruleset (ala Stars!). Also you will need to have at least one implementation of a game that uses the races in some way - easiest is Minisec, but if others are working on another project building a ruleset, you may work with them. Race files need to be verified in some manner on the server, so take into account how to do this easily.

== MetaServer ==

The metaserver was originally written in about 5 hours, it was then improved as part of last years Summer of Code. It is in a pretty good shape but needs some polish before we can deploy it as our main server. Once a release has been made, more features can then be added.

You job will be to,
* clean up and release the metaserver,
* add more functionality to the metaserver.

Some suggestions for new features include,
* Make it portable across databases
* Add a "match making" support
* Intergrate with the [http://forums.thousandparsec.net/ forums] and [http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/mailman.php/listinfo/ mailing lists].
* Add request via standalone UDP or TCP ports.

==== Required Skills ====
* Some PHP skills.

== Thousand Parsec Protocol ==

These projects are about improving a core part of Thousand Parsec. They may require a smaller amount of code then other projects, but the code will have to be of a much higher quality.

Any changes to the core protocol will need to be vetted by other Thousand Parsec members and approved. This means that these projects may be slower to progress and more frustrating. They will generally be more rewarding as you will know that you have helped with a fundamental part of Thousand Parsec and every one else is doing work based on yours.

=== Protocol compliance test suite ===

Currently protocol libraries have no way of testing their compliance with the protocol specification. Your job would be to write a suite which runs a protocol library through a bunch of tests and report on it's compliance.

==== More Information ====
* [http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/dev/documents/protocol3.php Protocol 3]
* [http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/dev/documents/protocol4.php Protocol 4], [http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/dev/documents/protocolxml.php xml description]
* [http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=documents.git;a=summary Documents repository]

==== Required Skills ====
* Some experience with testing is a must

= Python Stuff =

Thousand Parsec uses a lot of python. These projects are generally to do with improve some python part of Thousand Parsec.

== Intergrate and improve schemepy ==

[http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=schemepy.git;a=summary Schemepy] is a Python ctypes library that Mithro started to allow Python to call out to various supported C Scheme implimentations (such as [http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html Guile]). This makes processing scheme 10 to 100 times faster then the current pyscheme.

Pyscheme is currently used by all the Python parts, include [Python Server] and the [Python Client]. It also has wider application in the Python community and it is recommended that you also work closely with the Python Software Foundation.

You job is to do (some) of the following,
* Add support for various other C scheme libraries such as [http://www.plt-scheme.org/software/mzscheme/ mzscheme], [http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/ chicken], [http://freshmeat.net/redir/gauche/19776/url_homepage/gauche Gauche], [http://freshmeat.net/projects/sizzle/ Sizzle] or [http://tinyscheme.sourceforge.net/home.html TinyScheme]. The more popular scheme libraries should be preferred.
* Add support for [http://freshmeat.net/projects/sisc/ SISC], [http://freshmeat.net/projects/gleam/ Gleam] or other Java scheme implimentations when run under Jython.
* Add support for python scheme implimentation as fallbacks, both [http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/python/pyscheme/ pyscheme] and [http://code.google.com/soc/2007/psf/appinfo.html?csaid=7DEFE8FECA98BD0B PyPy Scheme] (code found [https://codespeak.net/viewvc/pypy/dist/pypy/lang/scheme/ here]).

You will also need to do these at a minimum,
* Create a strong scheme and tpcl test suite including benchmarking.
* Port [http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=tpserver-py.git;a=summary tpserver-py] to use the schemepy interface.
* Port [http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=libtpclient-py.git;a=summary libtpclient-py] to use the schemepy interface.

==== Required Skills ====
Some Python skills are a '''must'''. Having used either scheme or python-ctypes is a strong plus but not required. Experiance building compliance and/or testing suits is also a bonus.

== tpsai-py - RFTS ruleset ==

[http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=tpsai-py.git;a=summary tpsai-py] is a simple AI written in Python using the [http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=libtpclient-py.git Client] and [http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=libtpproto-py.git Protocol] libraries. It has only had a couple of days worth of work and is still very simple. It currently does an okay job at playing [http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/dev/documents/minisec.php MiniSec].

Your job is to clean up and extend it to support either [[TP RFTS]] ruleset or [http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/documents/mtsec.php MTSec] ruleset. You can see the [http://www.thousandparsec.net/wiki/Ideas_for_Programmers#AI_Clients AI Clients] section for more information on what you would need to do.

== Port tpserver-py to Twisted ==

The python server currently uses it's own async core loop. Your job is to port it to the [http://twistedmatrix.com/ twisted framework], this will be a multiple stage process.

* Step 1 - Port the core to Twisted's reactor, see [http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=libtpproto-py.git;a=blob;f=tp/netlib/twist.py libtpproto-py twist.py] for a start of this.
* Step 2 - Change the SQL queries to using the async thread worker pool. [http://foss.eepatents.com/sAsync/ See this documentation] about how this could be done.
* Step 3 - Change any print statements to be logging statements.
* Step 4 - Make tpserver-py daemonize.
* Step 5 - Add support for an inbuilt http server - including authentication (to allow download of media and battle data etc)
* Step 6 - Add support for multicast DNS/Zeroconf to Twisted.
* Step 7 - Add a ssh/telnet port that lets programs remotely manage the server (such as add/remove games, etc).
* Step 8 - Party

'''Note:''' It is important that tpserver-py still has "zero install and setup" option which means that you can just get a copy of the code and type ./tpserver-py

==== Required Skills ====
Strong Python skills are '''required''', experience with twisted is also strongly advised.

== Create a new ruleset for tpserver-py ==

See the [[#Rulesets|Rulesets]] section for more information.

== Add testing to libtpproto-py ==

The python library currently as no testing. It's your job to write enough tests that at least 60% of the code has proper testing.

'''More Information:'''
* libtpproto-py

'''Required Skills''':
* Some experience with unit testing and Python is a must.

== Finish libtpproto2-py ==

libtpproto2-py is the second generation protocol library designed to automatically generate packet descriptions from xml. It is pretty close to being finished and just needs a little love. It also need a large amount of testing.

You should then port libtpclient-py to the library.

==== More Information ====
* [http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=libtpproto-py.git libtpproto-py] - The original Python protocol library.
* [http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=libtpproto-py.git libtpproto2-py] - The "second generation" protocol library.

==== Required Skills ====
* Some experience with [http://www.python.org/ Python] is a must.

== Help develop wxWidget client ==

[http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/downloads.php#tpclient-pywx tpclient-pywx] is currently the primary client for access Thousand Parsec, there are many things which can be done to improve it. 

You should take some of these suggestions and build them into a consistent proposal suitable for 3 months. You '''MUST''' download and used the client before trying to write an application. You also need to talk to [mithro@mithis.com Mithro] as you will be working closely with him if you take on this idea.

These tasks are in no particular order and some are more difficult then others. 

===== Save window perspective =====
The client should restore all the windows to the same position/size/location. See the wxAUI demo for the window saving perspective code.

===== Improve info panel data display =====
The info panel is the primary display for information about the currently selected object. Currently it is really crappy looking. Make it look nicer.

===== "Distance to" window =====
Add a window which replaces the starmap and shows the distant from the currently selected object to every other object in the Universe. Should be able to filter and sort on various criteria. This would be useful for blind players to fully access the game.

===== Asset report =====
Add a window which lists all your various assets.

===== Add proper tech tree browser =====
TP04 will support technology trees. Add support for viewing these to tpclient-pywx.

FreeOrion has quite a cool looking tech-browser, see http://www.optisch-edel.de/fo/screenshots/research.jpg

===== Add message board functionality =====
Add full, proper message board support to tpclient-pywx.

Features should include;
* Ability to see all message boards on the server.
* The ability to post new messages.
* To easily filter various system messages in intelligent ways.
* Good searching facility.

===== Add undo support =====

Add the ability to undo any action. This probably comes in multiple parts,
* Adding a change tracker to libtpclient-py
* Adding the ability to revert specific things using the the change tracker

===== Add a cool 3d starmap =====

It would be pretty easy to embedded an OpenGL window where the starmap is currently. Why not make a cool 3d starmap while still having access to all the GUI elements.

Look into using something like pyglet or python-ogre.

== Improve wxWidget's pyAUI ==

The next version of tpclient-pywx, the primary Thousand Parsec client is heavily dependent on pyAUI. There are a bunch of improvements which could be added to make pyAUI even better. Some examples are,

* Minimise button support
* Add better way to align the windows initially
* Add better support for using floating MDI children under Windows
* Add support for "fly out" windows (IE Windows which only show themselves when moused over)
* Tab-based MDI classes (see C++ AUI)
* Vertical Title bars

Feel free to add more ideas, a good place to look is wxAUI Forums.
