== Ruleset Documentation ==
The ruleset will emulate an almost complete game of Risk with a modification to the turn structure. Instead of turns playing out player-by-player they play out in a more 4X “all-at-once” fashion. The only features not guaranteed (but very likely) in the GSoC iteration will be continent-ownership based reinforcements and a cards system.


== Starting Turns ==
*An option will exist for games to begin by random assignment of territories to players or by turn-based selection of territories. Conflicts between players can be resolved by dice roll. The losing player may be given the opportunity to pick a new territory in a solitary turn, or by random assignment. Each territory will receive one unit from that player (to signal ownership). 
**It may be possible to not require a unit to signify ownership, as TP can easily remember who owns what; undefended territory will simply require an enemy unit moving onto it to claim it.
*Players will then proceed to place additional units onto their territories. This may be done all at once, or x amount per player per round. It may seem more fair to players if the latter is used.
*Having finished starting turns normal play will then begin.


== Normal Turns ==
Contrary to my concurrent proposal, this version of my ruleset will have players taking turns at the same time. Each round will be a short, 10-20 second round, wherein each player can make one move or attack. Conflicts between players, say two territories attack eachother, can be resolved by evening the odds from 3-2 attack-defense to 3-3 attack-attack. Other conflicts, for example, attacking a territory, with a retreating defender, can be resolved with reduced odds for the defender, 3-1 instead of 3-2.
As for a logical turn structure it goes as follows:
*At the start of each set of x turn players will receive reinforcements based upon how many territories they own (sorry no "continents" or cards yet.) x will be some number of turns found to be a fair (via testing.)
**If it is possible I would like for the reinforcements turn to be a longer turn, around a minute or so. 
**Once the reinforcement turn is finished all units allocated will be “built” on the location they are issued.
*During normal “micro-turns” players will have a short amount of time to issue a singular order. Orders are executed at turns end, with results reported back to the user.
**This attack system will be easy to manage because each attack "round" or movement can be an "action."
**With the modified ruleset there exist possible conflicts to be managed; Some such conflicts are:
***Two territories attacking each other
***Defending territory is also retreating
***etc.


== Winning/Losing ==
*Should a player be completely wiped out they are exited from the game. It is a possibility that the user could still spectate the game, as having no territories owned would simply "skip" their turn.
*Should a player own every territory they win the game. It is also a possibility that owning a certain percentage of territories would constitute a win. This could be a server option.


== Example Game Session ==
I'd like to walk through a general sample of a few turns of the ruleset. The example will have 5 territories, A through E, all fully connected to eachother. 2 players, X and Y, will be playing.
*The game begins. Objects A through E are created, with all their connections.
*Both players are informed they can place one colony, as they are in the Colonization phase.
*X and Y both try to colonize A. A random number is generated and X wins the colony.
*The next round disallows all players except Y from acting. Y can choose to colonize a different colony. Y picks E
*There are still unclaimed territories so X and Y claim B and D respectively.
*Next round only C remains, X and Y both try to claim it, Y wins.
*X now owns A, B. Y now owns C, D, E
*X will get 4 reinforcements to place, and Y will get 6. (This is some arbitrary number of reinforcements per territory)
*Both players place 3 reinforcements per turn (so everyone can see what is being place where) until all reinforcements are spent.
*X places 2 units on A and B. Y places 2 on C, D but only 1 on E. Y has 1 reinforcement left.
*Y neglects to place his last unit, and after 2 absent turns, forfeits those units. Normal play now begins
*X decides to attack E from A, Y decides to attack B from D. Both players are completely successful, except neither moves units onto their conquered territories.
*At this point X owns A(2), E(0). Y owns B(0), C(2), D(2).
*X and Y now both try to attack eachother on A and C. This situation calls for even odds, Y defeats one unit of A.
*At this point X owns A(1), E(0). Y owns B(0), C(2), D(2).
*X now tries to retreat from A to E. Y attacks A from C. This situation calls for reduced odds for A, unfortunetely, and A is defeated. Y moves one unit onto A
*At this point X owns E(0). Y owns A(1),B(0), C(2), D(2).
*X isn't defeated yet, as he still owns one territory. Luckily for him there is a reinforcement round next. X receives 2 units which he places on E. Y receives 8, and places them all on B.
*At this point X owns E(2). Y owns A(1),B(8), C(2), D(2).
*X attempts to attack A from E, Y attacks E from B. Since E is retreating it takes reduced odds on the roll, and Y's 8 units crush X's 


== Features for Further Implementations ==
These features will either be implemented in later iterations of the ruleset or at the conclusion of GSoC should a basic ruleset be finished early.
*Continent-ownership based reinforcements. This feature would extend the first iteration by providing additional reinforcements should a player completely control a star cluster.
*Cards. This feature may involve extending the server a little, as I don't see it as ideal to have "cards" count as little ships; I just don't see that as a very refined approach.
*Rock-Paper-Scissor interaction of different unit types. This would involve 3 (or more) different types of units, either costing the same amount of reinforcements to create, or variable costs. This would need a tight leash on it as it could quickly transform the ruleset into something entirely not Risk-like and more 4X-space-game like. It is a possibility that the ruleset could fork into other derivatives.
*A bevy of other features from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_2210_A.D. ''Risk 2210 A.D.'' ]. If you notice any features in 2210 you would like to see in the GSoC iteration please leave a comment at the end of the page.
