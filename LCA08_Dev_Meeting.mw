Several developers are going to be/are/were at '''LCA08''' in Melbourne. This page is about the topics of the '''developments meeting(s)''' help there. Feel free to add things we should discuss. It is likely that not everything will be discussed.

= Vision, Goals, Games and AI =
Vision and goals are fairly straight forward. Just need to be articulated.

The protocol and tpserver-cpp (and others) now supports a lot more features than Minisec or MTSec will use. Are we doing the right thing?

Writing a good AI is hard. The processing power needed is not trivial, and log files are huge. Do we need more AI development/framework/etc, or do we need to "eat our own dogfood" and play the games more?

= Please don't discuss things on this page =

All discussion should go on the mailing lists. This page is for documenting things which need discussion and their results.

= TP Protocol Version 4 =

This page http://blog.mithis.net/archives/tp/15-tp-protocol-overview is still quite relavent - will do an updated version.

== Research frames ==
When, what, how?

Although it is generally referred to as a research "tree", most games with unlockable technology actually implement a directed acyclic graph.  A technology that can be researched is represented by a node in this graph and dependencies on other technology is represented by the edges.

A frame describing a research node should probably contain the following:

* name
* long name
* description (flavor text)
* list of technologies that must be available before this one is researched
* list of resources required to research this technology
* list of universal references of things made available once this technology is researched (components, other technologies, etc...)

: But it can be very different from that. Some games support research only one technology at time, some support multiple, some don't even let the player choose. Some don't have specific technologies, just "areas" and at random intervals give a component, ability, etc. So it isn't quite as cut and dried as you have made it sound. We (mithro and I) talked about it last year and I guess we need a bit more. --[[User:Lee Begg|Lee Begg]] 00:48, 21 January 2008 (EST)

A research node doesn't necessarily describe a specific technology.  It could represent a broad "area".  A research tree made of areas would look something like this:

* Biology I <- Biology II <- Biology III <- ...
* Energy I <- Energy II <- Energy III <- ...
* Construction I <- Construction II <- Construction III <- ...
* ...

A research tree could be arranged linearly if the client is to be given no choice in what to study.  In such cases the only reason to send these frames would be to allow the client to choose what resources to allocate to research.  A simplified, linear "tree" might look like this on a client:

* Tech Level 1 <- Tech Level 2 <- Tech Level 3 <- ... 

As each node is researched it could bear fruit after, for example, the amount of "research points" allocated to it are spent.  Alternately, the server may not tell the client how long this research will take to complete.  In such cases the time needed to complete a node may be predetermined, but hidden or simply randomized.  Similarly, the results of completing a research node may be randomized or hidden from the client.  

Research nodes describe to the client what can be researched, but not how that research is accomplished.  I propose a system with minimal changes to the protocol and maximum flexibility.  In addition to a "research node" frame described above and a universal reference ID for referencing research nodes (or perhaps they should be called "technology descriptions" to be more consistent with other universally referenced objects), no changes to the protocol are required.

Clients will tell the server which tech to research by sending an order that references a technology node.  The object that the order is sent to may differ depending on the game, but will most likely be the first object belonging to the player with the name "Research" (or something similar).  In this common setup, each player has a single "research queue".  The server may allow research on more than one technology depending on the resources allocated to each order in the queue, or research may be limited to a single item at a time.

Having a default object (i.e. named "Research") allows the client to have a dedicated research menu or screen as many games do, but allows flexibility to implement research in different ways.  If a client cannot find the default object, the research screen would be unavailable.

Other implementations within this framework are possible.  Since each object can have their own research queue, research could be managed at the level of individual planets, buildings, "science vessels", etc...  Perhaps each object researching a technology has a certain chance of completing it on each turn.  The more planets, buildings, science vessels, etc. that are researching that tech, the faster it would be completed.  Such systems would not need to be implemented on the client.  The standard order system would be enough.

: I believe this addresses all the specific situations mentioned by Lee.  It certainly covers all requirements to emulate the games I've played, but my experience is limited.  I welcome any further criticism. --[[User:MidoriKid|MidoriKid]] 17:03, 21 January 2008 (EST)

== Diplomacy frames ==
When, what, how?

Leave for TP05.

== Formatted Strings? ==

From the protocol3.php
<pre>
Formatted Strings are exactly like normal strings but use the structured text
method for formatting their contents. For a complete description of structured
text please see the following document. This allows display of color, underline,
super/subscript and much more. It is also easy to convert to plain text or HTML.
</pre>

Except there is no "following document".

== Time is deranged ==

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1826443&group_id=132078&atid=723099

== Implementation ==
When is everything going to talk it?

== General reference selection list order parameter ==
Finish discussion from mailing list and get it added to the order parameters.

== Metaserver protocol ==

Finish any discussion about this..

== SSL filters vs SSL port ==
AKA features vs filters...

We now have two ways to create a secure connection between client and server, first is the ssl port, and new in TP04 is the ssl filter. Do we need both? Do we need a way for the server to force security in some form on a client before the login frame?

In general, some of the feature Ids could be removed, or made into filters. What do we do?

== Media protocol ==

Need to figure this out.

== BattleXML ==

Need to figure this out.

= Website re-org and change to wiki =
Are we going to change it? When? Who?

Also update to metaserver-lite-rewrite?

ikiwiki - Combinding website and wiki into one.

= Packaging =
(Suggested by pschulz01)

= GSoC Money =

What to do with it? What about money from swag,

 * Another competition?
 * TP Developers conference?
 * Better servers?
 * Start up non-profit
