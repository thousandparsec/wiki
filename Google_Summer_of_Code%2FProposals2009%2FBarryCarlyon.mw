Web Based Client

Summary

Taking the Python Client as an example I am to reproduce most if not all the functionality of the Python client in a web based form, using the relevant API.
Primarily I am a PHP coder, so this will be coded in PHP using a relevant JavaScript platform to provide AJAX functionality.

Proposal

A few years ago I used to play the web based Game Ferion, which is similar in fashion to thousand parsec, given that it is a Space Based game, the aim being to conquer the opponents.
I aim to implement all four of the initail ideas listed, in such a way so to allow the Client to be used for any ruleset as defined by their controlling files.

TimeLine

Initial Needs:
Generate Cron based data updater, I need to determine caching requirements, would it be quicker to store data in a mysql server, as apposed to querying the server a lot,
User Authentication to the server,
The Star Map I initially see as a Key Part to the Client, this will need to be key to  the Web Based Server

XML-RPC transfer seems the most appropriate method for Object data transfer, loaded asynchronously from the server

Issuing Orders should be relatively straight forward, keeping things logical will be the harder part.

Design Creation and management will take the longest bulk of the time

Regardless of TimeLine, I will endeavour to be further involved with TP, both as a player and as the web client developer.

Important

Tools/Technologies
PHP for main website coding
xHTML 1.1 for the HTML
Jquery seems the likely JavaScript platform to be used, as this time I have  never used a JavaScript platform other than Scriptaculous, which is a JavaScript Effects Library
CSS for styling
XML-RPC, for object description, from a central data server.

Mock Up
Will be drawing one up this weekend, as well as looking at the PHP interface library. For some code samples

Myself
GSoC is an interesting platform, however it can be difficult to find a project, that fits my skill set, I'm not a programming in the sense that one builds a programme to run continuously, such as the Thousand Parsec server, but more of a coder who builds websites. So the Web Based Client for Thousand Parsec instantly stood out as an interesting project.
I have also been friends with (IRC Name) Landon since Last Years GSoC and he said he was going with Thousand Parsec this year, so thought I would check out this years project list.
I was the recent winner of the Gary Frisch Bursary for Software in radio, for my Open Source Content Management System, which currently runs the LSRfm.com (Leeds Student Radio) website, (http://LSRfm.com/). This CMS (Carlyon CMS) I will use to form the basis of the web based Client.
I used to be able to program perl, but of late have not had the change to practice it so my perl is rusty, I am currently learning Ruby on Rails and Coldfusion as well.
My aim in life is to continue working in the MultiPlatform Radio Environment in the UK, which is pretty much what I do at the moment as a Volunteer at LSRfm.com where I am Head of Web Development.

Last year I was involved with the Now Aborted, One Bug Tracker to Rule them all Project over at PHP.
