=== Short short version ===

Extend Daneel-ai to support MiniSec and MTSec rulesets. Make coding AI for new rulesets as easy as possible.

=== Short version ===

Since human players are not that easy to find every ruleset should have an AI opponent one can play against. MiniSec and MTSec rulesets are stable and don't have AI opponents (not sure if tpsai counts) so extending Daneel-ai to support them would make it the main AI client. While working on the AI for these rulesets I would try to simplify the creation of AI for new rulesets as much as possible (through extended functionality and tutorials/documentation). Currently AI logic is meant to be written in CHR syntax, I would like to add a simple way of coding AI in python only so future developers could write pure python AI if they choose (and some thing are just easier that way). Any time left would be spend on speed improvements and adding common AI algorithms for easier future use.

=== Long version ===

I believe that it is essential for a game to have a moderately challenging AI especially if it doesn't have a large user base.
Adding support for MiniSec and MTSec in Daneel-ai would mean it covers most of the stable rulesets.
With this Daneel-ai would become the main AI client and first choice for future AI coding. This would mean less code to maintain.

I have already started with work on AI for MiniSec and have noticed the documentation and tutorials are not complete. As a part of my work I would complete the documentation and write a step by step tutorial on creating AI for new rulesets.
I have also written code for automatic discovery of all possible orders (and their arguments) on a given ruleset. More functions like this one would be added for simplifying writing of AI for new rulesets.


As it is now 4 AM I should get some sleep before I continue...
