media.gz is a file which the client can download from a media server to get details about what is available. It will always be found off the base url of the server.

The file is a gziped plain text file with the format as specified below,
<pre>
<filename> <size> <last modtime> <checksum type>:<checksum>"
</pre>

* The size is in bytes.
* The last modtime is in the format <year>-<month>-<day>T<hour><minute>, all should have leading zeros.
* Checksum type can be, md5 or sha1, other hash formats may be supported in the future.
* Checksum is a hexdump of the checksum for the file (IE How we normally view MD5 sums, 6afb6b9187f5aa5d4168ae71fb3f27b0).

The filename for every media file type on the server should be included. An example media.gz is included below,

</pre>

Thousand Servers will not give full URLs, instead it will give a URL leaving out the media extension. It is up to the client to choose the file type that is requires.

For example,
<pre>
Server's base url:  http://media.thousandparsec.net/media/
Object's media url: planets/planet1
</pre>

If the client supported mng, it could download the 
<pre>
http://media.thousandparsec.net/media/planets/planet1.mng
</pre>
