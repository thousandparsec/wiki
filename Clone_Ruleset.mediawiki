One of the greatest board (and later computer) games is Avalon Hills Diplomacy game. Focusing on diplomacy between the players, forcing them to ally, lie, cheat, support and often backstab each other the game was (and is) a classic. Without the diplomacy aspect it becomes a fairly average war game - with the diplomacy aspect, it's simple support-based combat system, secret orders and general tight confines make for an engaging and deep gaming experience.

TP itself is missing some basic in turn messaging, but otherwise a ruleset using some of the ideas from Diplomacy to create fairly simple diplomatic game - in space could be done. Some work on how to turn adjacent countries/territories into space fleets need to done.

The goal of this project is to implement a Diplomacy style game - one focused on shifting alliances and political manoeuvring, rather then pure military might. Messaging between players will need to implemented in a server and client, and minor protocol adjustments will need to be made to allow messaging between players.
