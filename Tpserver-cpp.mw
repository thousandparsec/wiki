'''tpserver-cpp''' is a Thousand Parsec server written in C++. Most of the server was written by [[User:Lee Begg|Lee]], with the [[TP RFTS]] ruleset written by xdotx, and a number of patches from other people.

==Implemented Rulesets==
* [[Minisec]]
* [[MTSec]] (WIP)
* [[TP RFTS]]

==Setup==
See [[Tpserver-cpp Setup]] for some hints on building tpserver-cpp.

To quick-start a game, use the corresponding quickstart-''rulesetname''.conf configuration files. For more options, see the sample.conf files.

==Documentation==

* Snapshot version of the [http://code.thousandparsec.net/~lee/ruleset-book.pdf Ruleset Development Book]. Updated sometimes, based on ruleset-book in git. 
* Pages on [http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/dev/documents/tpserver-cpp main website]. Mostly well out of date.
* [[Tpserver-cpp/Sockets|Sockets]] and the flow of data.
* [[Tpserver-cpp/Admin|Remote Administration]] - documentation on separating out the console and daemonizing the server.
* Add pages on the wiki here...

==Future work ideas==
