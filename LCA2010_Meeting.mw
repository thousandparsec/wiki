= LCA2010 Meeting =

Meetings at LCA 2010 in Wellington, New Zealand (and online). 18 - 23 Jan 2010

This page is about the topics of the meeting(s) held there and online. Feel free to add things we should discuss. It is likely that not everything will be discussed.

== Please don't discuss things on this page ==
All discussion should go on the mailing lists. This page is for documenting things which need discussion and their results.

== Vision, Goals, Games and AI ==
Vision and goals are fairly straight forward. Just need to be articulated. 

The protocol and tpserver-cpp (and others) now supports a lot more features than Minisec or MTSec will use. Are we doing the right thing? 

Writing a good AI is hard. The processing power needed is not trivial, and log files are huge. Do we need more AI development/framework/etc, or do we need to "eat our own dogfood" and play the games more? 

== Org ==
Establishing Org to support Thousand Parsec.

This may require electing officers, approving constitution, approving payments, etc.

== Development Sprint ==

Where, when? Etc.

== TP04 ==

=== Research Frames ===
No progress since last year. [[Research Frames|Proposal]] still current.

=== Mod Time/Serial update ===
No changes have been made yet

=== BattleXML ===
Have mostly ok format, but no way to get it from the server.

== Website re-org and change to wiki ==
Are we going to change it? When? Who?

Also update to metaserver-lite-rewrite?
