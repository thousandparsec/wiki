= Getting the code =

If you only have git installed, try
<pre>
git clone git://git.thousandparsec.net/git/tpclient-pywx.git

# Check all the requirements are satisified
cd tpclient-pywx
pythonw requirements.py

# Now run the client!
pythonw tpclient-pywx
</pre>

== WARNING ==

'''WARNING: Make sure the pythonw you are running is the one you installed above (you may need to modify your path). '''

To check you are running the correct python do something like this
<pre>
# You are looking for the version 2.5 and not 2.4 or 2.3
pythonw
