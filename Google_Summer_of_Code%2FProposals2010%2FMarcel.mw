= Parsek improvement proposal =

== Short version ==

Improve thousand parsec's KDE4 client Parsek to the point that it is possible to play a game with it.
The improvement includes a user friendlier user interface which looks more like a game client than a chat client.
Add missing client parts like star-map, proper account-manager, settings.

== Long version ==

KDE4 as a project has only mini games, a 4X game would improve the KDE gaming sector.
Tpclient-pywx doesn't fully fit into a KDE Desktop and tpclient-pyogre which is a 3D client
requires a suited graphic card. Parsek fills out the hole and the developing should be continued until it
is a decent 4X game client for KDE4.

=== User interface improvements ===
==== Graphics/art ====
A game client should contain proper, nice looking graphics.
Games with gray/white areas and buttons are not modern games.
By removing the standard gray/white background of the widgets, adding some contrast and colors, Parsek could look like a commercial game client.

==== Login/start window ====
The first GUI the user will see. It provides a basic account manager and server selection.
Account informations will be saved over kwallet.
A way to setup a single-player game could be implemented later there, too.

==== Game window ====
The game window contains all game related widgets such as a star-map, chat, resource overview.
Most of the widgets can be moved around to customize the client to the needs of the user.

==== Star map ====
Visual representation of the universe includes eg. planets, ships and orders.
Orders can be given by right clicking on an object and selecting sub-objects or an order such as a build command.
The star map takes most of the game window's space and is located in the center.

==== Settings ====
Account, graphic and network settings.

==== KDE4 integration ====
Saving account related data in kwallet.
Native notifications for chat messages or other events.

==== Resource-bar ====
To see the state of the current economy a resource-"bar" is needed, it should look similar to other strategy games.
Possible integration into the star map.

==== Chat ====
The chat widget has a chat history which could be embedded into the star map.
New chat messages would "pop-up" in the star map and fade away after a few seconds.
A new chat message can be written by eg. pressing enter, typing the message and pressing enter again.
Optional a native KDE4 notification can be triggered, this would be a option in settable in the settings widget.
