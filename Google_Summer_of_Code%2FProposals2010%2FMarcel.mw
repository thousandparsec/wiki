= Parsek improvement proposal =

== Short version ==

Improve thousand parsec's KDE4 client Parsek to the point that it is possible to play a game with it.
The improvement includes a user friendlier user interface which looks more like a game client than a chat client.
Add missing client parts like star-map, proper account-manager, settings.

== Long version ==

KDE4 as a project has only mini games, a 4X game would improve the KDE gaming sector.

=== User interface improvements ===
Graphics/art:
Removing the standard gray/white background of the widgets, adding some contrast and colors
to change the client to something a commercial game client would look like.

Login/start window:
First GUI the user will see. It provides a basic account manager and server selection.
Account informations will be saved over kwallet.
A way to setup a single-player game could be implemented later there, too.

Game window:
The game window contains all game related widgets such as a star-map, chat, resource overview.
The star map takes most of the game window's space and is located in the center.
A resource overview will be provided at the top with a "resource-bar".
Chat widget is on the bottom. Most of the widgets can be moved around to customize the client to the needs of the user.

Star map:
Visual representation of the universe includes eg. planets, ships and orders.
Orders can be given by right clicking on an object and selecting sub-objects or an order such as a build command.

Settings:
Account, graphic and network settings.

KDE4 integration:
Saving account related data in kwallet.
Native notifications for chat messages or other events.

Resource-bar:
To see the state of the current economy a resource-"bar" is needed similar to other strategy games.
