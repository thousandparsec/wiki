This page documents some ways of getting [[tpserver-cpp]] built.

==mithro's setup==
The follow is how mithro sets up his server, YMMV.

<pre>
cg-clone git://git.thousandparsec.net/git/libtprl.git
cd libtprl
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/opt/tpserver-cpp
make
sudo make install

cd ..
cg-clone git://git.thousandparsec.net/git/tpserver-cpp.git
cd tpserver-cpp
./autogen.sh
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/tpserver-cpp/lib/pkg_config ./configure --prefix=/opt/tpserver-cpp
make
sudo make install

mkdir /opt/tpserver-cpp/etc
cp quickstart-* /opt/tpserver-cpp/etc
cd /opt/tpserver-cpp/bin
./tpserver-cpp -C ../etc/quickstart-<gametype>
</pre>

== Building on Mac OS X with Fink ==
Start with tpserver-cpp version 0.5.1 or later. Many fixes where made for Mac OS X in 0.5.1.


Guile 1.6 or 1.8 must be installed before configuring.  Instructions for using version 1.8 are shown here.

<pre>
fink install guile18 guile18-dev
</pre>

Since Guile depends on readline, that package will automatically be installed by Fink.  By default, the makefile will use the built-in BSD version, which is incompatible.  Setting the following environment will tell the configure script of libtprl where to look for the correct headers.

<pre>
export CPPFLAGS=-I/sw/include
</pre>
