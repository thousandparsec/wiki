One could say that the '''Thousand Parsec protocol''' is the basis on which everything else in Thousand Parsec project is built on. It defines the features that are available to ruleset writers, it defines how servers should work and what clients should be able to handle and how clients and servers communicate.

Currently the latest available version of Thousand Parsec protocol is [http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/dev/documents/protocol3.php TP03], which builds on and extends the older versions [http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/dev/documents/protocol2.php TP02] and [http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/dev/documents/protocol.php TP01].

The fourth version of the protocol ([[TP04]]) is in active development. So this is the perfect chance for anyone to comment on the planned features and suggest additions that would make more interesting 4X games possible.
