My name is Victor Ivri (forum and IRC: vi1985). I'm double majoring in Computer science and Cognitive science at York U, Toronto, Canada. My main interest is in the field of AI. I'm interested in both the practical implementations of various forms of AI, and in the philosophical and psychological underpinnings of it. Currently, I don't blog, blob, blab or blag[http://blag.xkcd.com/], but I have a facebook account, where you can check out my photos, and generally stalk me. 

Other than blankly staring at code, I enjoy wilderness backpacking, downtown at night, and good company.
