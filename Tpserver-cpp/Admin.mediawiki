The '''remote administration''' project intends to remove the internal console from [[tpserver-cpp]] and replace it with a protocol which can be accessed by administration clients in a variety of useful ways. This was originally developed for [[Google Summer of Code]] 2008 by Aaron Mavrinac / [[User:Ezod|ezod]]. 

== Administration Protocol Extension ==

=== Overview ===

The administration client will connect and authenticate in a manner similar to the game [[protocol]]. Once connected, it may receive log messages and  issue commands.

The main CLI client must store all available command descriptions locally (for command line verification, tab completion, etc.). It initially grabs the full current command set from the server upon a successful connection. After any operation which could result in new commands becoming available on the server, such as loading a ruleset, this local set must be updated.

Some command IDs are static and reserved for important server commands which all servers support. These include the commands which will be used by tpclient-pywx and other game clients to start a local server for single-player mode.

=== Summary ===

The following table contains both existing [[protocol]] frames and new administration-related frames (the latter are bold). The server must support all of these frame types and ignore others.

This protocol extension requires '''version 0.3 or greater''' of the TP protocol.
