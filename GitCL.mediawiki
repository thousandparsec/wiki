 # Create the new branch
 git checkout -b my-new-feature
 
 # Hack, Hack 
 git add
 git commit
 
 # Upload to code review
 git cl upload
 
 # Fix from the code review
 git add
 git commit
 
 # Upload the new change
 git cl upload
 
 # Now we need to merge back into the main branch
 git checkout master 
 git merge --squash my-new-feature
 git commit # Add a comment about what this change does
 
 # Now push the change
 git push
